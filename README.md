### These are the core and basic scripts from original role playing game named SVT,  which represents speed,time and velocity.

1.  Important scripts can be reused else where, so I included some notes for further reusing.
2.  Some notes are directly taken in the script, but most of the script pieces are not written well and should be ignored or abandoned.
3.  The game itself won Runner-up in the National Digital Media Technology competition in 2019.
4.  The unimportant sides such as game introduction and anything not related to the reusable scripts but directly to the game itself is omitted here in my note.
